I recently switched the theme here in order to inspire myself to write more content. The only thing I was having issue with was getting code blocks to work correctly.

Below is a sample from the [markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown) reference:

```ruby
require 'redcarpet'
markdown = Redcarpet.new("Hello World!")
puts markdown.to_html
```

Some python thrown in to see what it looks like
```python
import stuff
 s = "Python syntax highlighting"
 print s
 ```

What I finally found was that I needed to change the _config.yml in the root of my github pages repo. In order for the stylesheet to pickup on fenced markdown code blocks, the following was needed:

```yml
pygments: true
markdown: redcarpet
redcarpet:
  extensions:
    - hard_wrap
    - no_intra_emphasis
    - autolink
    - strikethrough
    - fenced_code_block
```
By adding this, the correct classes are now added to any fenced blocks

## A New Theme

I recently switched the theme here in order to inspire myself to write more content. The only thing i'm having issue with is getting code blocks to work correctly.

Below is a sample from the [markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown) reference:

```ruby
require 'redcarpet'
markdown = Redcarpet.new("Hello World!")
puts markdown.to_html
```

Short Term Concerns:

1. Nashville Schools - even though the school system is getting better, it is not very good. In particular, the high schools have some serious issues, as does the district in managing said high schools. The problem is that as Nashville becomes more gentrified, the issues will become sharper. Given the issues with schools in Davidson county, one must look to either private schools or down south to Williamson county. Which brings us to point 2.
2. Williamson County Politics - It's easy to sum this one up to one person, Marsha Blackburn. The fact that the representative from Williamson County is proud of the fact that she denies climate change is a sad one indeed. Given the demographics of Williamson county, these pollitics probably aren't going to change.
3. Salaries - living in WC vs Nashville Private Schools. Both cost more


Long Term Concerns:

1. Healthcare Costs
2. Changing Demographics

Persona Concerns:
1. Niche focus towards healthcare - not particularly interesting for me
2. non-technological pursuits - nashville just lacks what i find interesting.

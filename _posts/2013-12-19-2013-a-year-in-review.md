title: '2013: A Year in Review'
---
It's nearing the end of 2013 and I wanted to look back at some of the goals I set for myself this past year as well as reflect on some of the things that happened over the year.

The biggest change for me this past year was definitely the increase in running. The easiest way to describe is as a move from excercise to a pastime. My goal for the year was to enter and run in 4 races. It looks like i'm going to end the year at 6 races.

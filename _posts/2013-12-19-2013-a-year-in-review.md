title: '2013: A Year in Review'
---
It's nearing the end of 2013 and I wanted to look back at some of the goals I set for myself this past year as well as reflect on some of the things that happened over the year.

###running
The biggest change for me this past year was definitely the increase in running. The easiest way to describe is as a move from excercise to a pastime. My goal for the year was to enter and run in 4 races. It looks like i'm going to end the year at 6 races. However, my schedule ended up looking much different than I thought it would. Last year at this time I was planning on running my first half marathon along with 3 5k races. I ended up running 3 half marathons, 1 10k, and 2 5k races. For all but one of the half marathons I set a personal record. 

###building a product
My work on buckit.io ended up faltering and eventually stopping over the past year. However, I have two new projects that I am currently working on. Emporium.io is one, the other is Verse. Emporium is actually a project that i've been working on in some form or another for about 8 months. It's a project that I have waffled back and forth on and am not sure how or if I should pursue. I'm hoping to write a post on it soon.

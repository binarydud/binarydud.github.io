title: '2013: A Year in Review'
---
It's nearing the end of 2013 and I wanted to look back at some of the goals I set for myself this past year as well as reflect on some of the things that happened over the year.

###running
One of the biggest change for me this past year was the increase in running. Running moved from being just excercise to a pastime. My goal for the year was to enter and run in 4 races. I ende up running 6 races. Not only did I run 2 more races than I thought I would, the composition of the races was quite different. Last year at this time I was planning on running my first half marathon along with 3 5k races. I ended up running three half marathons, one 10k, and two 5k races. For all of the races except one of the half marathons I set a personal record. To recap I participated in 6 races, went through two pairs of shoes, ran over 830 miles. It was a good year for running.

###building a product
My work on buckit.io ended up faltering and eventually stopping over the past year. However, I have two new projects that I am currently working on. Emporium.io is  a private package repository for python developers. While Verse is a frontend for blogging via github pages. Hopefully, I will have posts on both these projects in the near future.

###enjoying family
The best thing to happen to me this year was the birth of my second daughter. She was born this summer and has been a joy to watch grow over the past 6 months. My oldest daughter turned two this year and it has been fun to watch her learn to use words to not only talk but to sing as well. Our family had some ups and downs, but it's been a wonderful year all around. I'm very excited to see what the future holds for us. 

Coming up next, some plans for 2014.
